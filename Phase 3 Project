# Bank Marketing Term Deposit Prediction – Phase 3 Project

## Overview
Predict which clients are likely to subscribe to a bank term deposit to help marketing campaigns target efficiently.

## Business Problem
Marketing is expensive. The bank wants to focus efforts on high-probability clients to increase subscriptions and save costs.

## Dataset
- Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository – Bank Marketing Dataset  
- 41,000+ clients with features like age, balance, campaign info, and previous responses  
- Target: Term deposit subscription (Yes/No)

## Modeling
- **Baseline Logistic Regression:** Accuracy 92%, Recall 44%  
- **Tuned Decision Tree:** Accuracy 91%, Recall 55%

## Top Features
- Number of campaign contacts  
- Previous positive responses  
- Account balance  
- Age  
- Last contact duration  

## Recommendations
- Focus marketing on high-probability clients  
- Optimize campaign contacts  
- Use key features to refine campaigns  
- Update models regularly  

## Next Steps
- Test Random Forest and Gradient Boosting  
- Deploy a dashboard for marketing teams  
- Retrain models as behavior changes
